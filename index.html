        <div class="bio"> Hello! I am Lucia and I am specialized in enhancing internal business processes, driving innovation, 
            and spearheading the digitalization of operations, always with a bit of tech flair.</div> 
         <div class="bio">I’ve kind of always found myself in roles where programming wasn’t just an option but a necessity. 
            And just last year, I dove into the deep end with backend development and getting different software to 
            talk to each other through API integrations. It’s been quite the journey, from solving physics problems to solving business 
            problems with a bit of code.</div>
        <div class="bio">My adventure with programming started back in high school with Turbo Pascal - 
            yes, it’s been a while! At university, while diving deep into physics, I got my hands dirty with C, 
            Python, and even played around with Wolfram Mathematica for my projects.
            It was all about algorithms and crunching data, which I absolutely loved.</div>
        <div class="bio">
        In the last 6 or 7 years, I started getting my feet wet with frontend projects.
        It was a new challenge, but I was all for it.</div>
        <div class="bio">I’m all about using my skills to help businesses run better.
        I’m always ready to learn and tackle the next challenge. Let’s make something great together!</div>
